    "description": "A supercar? Made by MG? It was more likely than you would think, but not really enough to be greenlit for production. Designed by Roy Axe with someone else's Lotus Esprit as a dimensional reference and the Ferrari 308 as an inspiration, the EX-E shook the automotive world in the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show because it was unlike any of MG's offerings back then. Initially just a show model, the EX-E was later enginnered to feature a detuned version of the Metro 6R4's engine placed amidship.",
