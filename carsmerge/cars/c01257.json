    "description": "Tesla was ahead of everyone else in EV technology, so much so that the Model S's range blows its competitors out of the pack and back. When everyone else is struggling to make their cars last for 100 miles in a single charge, this car is out there doing triple the amount. You may be wondering about the kind of voodoo tech that Tesla's hiding in secret, turns out it's just thousands of 18650 lithium ion batteries shoved at the bottom of the car.",
