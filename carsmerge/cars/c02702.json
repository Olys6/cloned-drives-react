    "description": "The finished One amphibious car was launched in Thailand four years after the initial concept was revealed and 3 subsequent design revisions were made. There were 2 reasons why FOMM decided to produce and sell the car in Thailand: the country has a flood problem and the local government was incentivising EV production.",
