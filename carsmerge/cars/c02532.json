    "description": "Megastar, which later became a subsidiary of New Concept AG, is a Swiss-owned company based in Liechtenstein. In 1997, they tried to compete with the likes of BMW and Mercedes in their home turf with the Emme, an 87% Brazillian luxury sedan. The body panels were made from their patented reinforced polymer plastic called veXtrim, which according to the company could resist revolver shots (???). From what I know, no one ordered the base spec during its short sales run.",
