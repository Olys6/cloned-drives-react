    "description": "The Mark LT marks take two at a luxury pickup truck by Ford, no pun intended. This time, the cargo cover gimmick has been thrown away and the truck no longer only powers the rear wheels. Surely enough, it did 10 times better in the sales department than its predecessor in the US. The Mexicans, in particular, loved it so much the Mark LT got a second generation just for them.",
