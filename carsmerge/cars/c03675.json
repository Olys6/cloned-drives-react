    "description": "Two years after the V12 variant's release, Hongqi announced a slightly cheaper V8 variant that makes 381hp. Now even the 408hp V12 isn't really enough to make this 3-ton unit go fast, but that's beside the point, because to quote Ed's Auto Reviews: \"It doesn't accelerate, it advances.\" Chinese millionaires would still want to throw their money on something like this, regardless of the specs.",
