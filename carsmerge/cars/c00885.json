    "description": "Added to the lineup the following year after its initial release was the Turbo R model, and, as the name implies, this model focused on driving performance. An SUV's identity these days is decided by its mixture ratio of cross country 4x4, station wagon and minivan characteristics. However in the Airtrek Turbo R, the bloodline of the Lancer Evolution runs strong, making it quite unique among SUV's.",
