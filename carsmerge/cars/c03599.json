    "description": "A convertible version of the DB4 wasn't shown by Aston Martin until the London Motor Show of 1961, almost three years after the DB4 saloon was first unveiled. As with the saloon, the styling of the convertible was the work of there Milanese coach builder, Carrozzeria Touring. It must be noted that it also shows a marked similarity to the Maserati 3500GT and Lancia Flaminia both of which were also styled by Touring at about the same time.",
