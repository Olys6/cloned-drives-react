    "description": "Before 1979, the shape of RHAM/1 was dramatically altered with a lowered roof, steeply raked windscreen, huge front airdam and lowered bonnet line. Both the fitting of fuel injection in place of the Weber carbs and reducing boost pressure to give maximum power of 650 bhp helped to reduce fuel consumption to around 4 mpg.",
